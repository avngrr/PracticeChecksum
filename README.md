# Checksum

Sum of a number string.

- Only sum number when the next number is the same.
- The string is a circle the last number is being compared with the first.

## Example 

1122 : Checksum is 3, first is the same as the second and the third is the same as the fourth number (1 + 2) = 3
1111 : Checksum is 4, all numbers count cause its all the same (1 + 1 + 1 + 1) = 4
1234 : Checksum is 0, none of the numbers are the same

### Bonus

Sum a different checksum when the index of the control number is at the half of the string.
